  "readme": "# Furtive\n\n_Currently under development._\n\nA forward-thinking, lightweight, CSS microframework. Minimal by design.\n\nFurtive is __truly__ mobile-first and nearly all dimensions are done in `rem`. \nIt also has a small footprint, cutting down on the bandwidth necessary \nfor downloading CSS. Furtive is intended to be just that, furtive. It's \nthe perfect starting point to get your project up and running.\n\nFurtive remains lightweight because it doesn't preoccupy itself with older browsers.\nAs a result, Furtive can use cutting edge tech like [flexbox](http://caniuse.com/#search=flex),\n[SVGs](http://caniuse.com/#search=svg), and limited vendor prefixing. It's also available\nin SCSS, CSS, and comes with a gulpfile for customizing the build.\n\n## Installation\n\nYou can install via [bower](http://bower.io):\n\n```\n$ bower install --save furtive\n```\n\nOr, you can install via [npm](http://npmjs.org):\n\n```\n$ npm install --save furtive\n```\nOr, you can clone the source:\n\n```\n$ git clone https://github.com/johnotander/furtive.git\n```\n\n### Using the SCSS\n\nIn your Scss file, you can import furtive:\n\n```scss\n@import \"/path/to/furtive/scss/all\";\n```\n\nOr, if you like, you can just import a subset of the files, they're located in the\n`scss` directory.\n\n#### Customizing the SCSS\n\nFurtive contains a file `scss/_variables.scss`, which allows for variable customization:\n\n```scss\n$font-family: 'Lato', Helvetica, sans-serif;\n$dark-gray: #222;\n$text-color: $dark-gray;\n$body-bg: #fafafa;\n\n@import \"/path/to/furtive/scss/all\";\n```\n\n### Using the CSS\n\nFurtive provides two CSS files: `furtive.css`, and a minified version `furtive.min.css`. In\norder to use one, you can add a `<link>` in your `<head>`.\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n  <!-- ... -->\n  <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/path/to/furtive/css/furtive.min.css\">\n  <!-- ... -->\n</head>\n<body>\n  <!-- ... -->\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n#### Grabbing from the CDN\n\nFurtive is also available on TODO CDN, in order to link from there you can add the following to your `<head>`:\n\n```html\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"//path/to/cdn/furtive.min.css\">\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nDetailed documentation can be found at [furtive.co](http://furtive.co).\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n\n## Contributing\n\n1. Fork it\n2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)\n3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)\n4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)\n5. Create new Pull Request\n\n## Thanks to the following:\n\n* [Normalize](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css) for the foundation.\n* [BASSCSS](http://basscss.com) for the inspiration.\n* [Fluidity](http://fluidity.sexy) for the inspiration.\n\nCrafted with <3 by [John Otander](http://johnotander.com) ([@4lpine](https://twitter.com/4lpine)).",
