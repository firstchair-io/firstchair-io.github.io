# Furtive

_Currently under development._

A forward-thinking, lightweight, CSS microframework. Minimal by design.

Furtive is __truly__ mobile-first and nearly all dimensions are done in `rem`. 
It also has a small footprint, cutting down on the bandwidth necessary 
for downloading CSS. Furtive is intended to be just that, furtive. It's 
the perfect starting point to get your project up and running.

Furtive remains lightweight because it doesn't preoccupy itself with older browsers.
As a result, Furtive can use cutting edge tech like [flexbox](http://caniuse.com/#search=flex),
[SVGs](http://caniuse.com/#search=svg), and limited vendor prefixing. It's also available
in SCSS, CSS, and comes with a gulpfile for customizing the build.

## Installation

You can install via [bower](http://bower.io):

```
$ bower install --save furtive
```

Or, you can install via [npm](http://npmjs.org):

```
$ npm install --save furtive
```
Or, you can clone the source:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/johnotander/furtive.git
```

### Using the SCSS

In your Scss file, you can import furtive:

```scss
@import "/path/to/furtive/scss/all";
```

Or, if you like, you can just import a subset of the files, they're located in the
`scss` directory.

#### Customizing the SCSS

Furtive contains a file `scss/_variables.scss`, which allows for variable customization:

```scss
$font-family: 'Lato', Helvetica, sans-serif;
$dark-gray: #222;
$text-color: $dark-gray;
$body-bg: #fafafa;

@import "/path/to/furtive/scss/all";
```

### Using the CSS

Furtive provides two CSS files: `furtive.css`, and a minified version `furtive.min.css`. In
order to use one, you can add a `<link>` in your `<head>`.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <!-- ... -->
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="/path/to/furtive/css/furtive.min.css">
  <!-- ... -->
</head>
<body>
  <!-- ... -->
</body>
</html>
```

#### Grabbing from the CDN

Furtive is also available on TODO CDN, in order to link from there you can add the following to your `<head>`:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="//path/to/cdn/furtive.min.css">
```
